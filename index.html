Hello Team. Good day!
I am Manu, a systems guy. I am based out of Bangalore, India which is APAC. It’s the Silicon Valley around here. I have around four and half years of total IT experience and currently I am working with OPTYM as a Systems Administrator since three and half years.
We are into logistics optimization and network planning for Rail, Haul and SKY industries. Our infrastructure is hosted on VMWare and Azure IaaS and some AWS PaaS services.
Our smart folks code in Java, .Net, Angular and C#. CICD is on BitBucket > TC > Octopus and few projects are completely on Azure DevOps. Workloads are either on VMs or Docker containers. We have a modern and hybrid infrastructure. So where do I fit in?
Basically, I make sure that our people have everything they need to code, test and deploy the code. Mostly I build environments and fix them when somebody or something breaks something. It happens quite rarely. Let me brag about the things I do @OPTYM.

Cloud

We are on Azure. Two of our projects use ADO and AKS. I don’t get to work on these due to time zone difference and alignment, but I have worked on the IaaS side where we had one of our biggest projects called SKY SUITE, which Amadeus acquired last year.
- Helped develop ARM modules to build environments end-to-end. These modules include creations of key vaults, vNets, virtual machines, storage accounts, HPC deployment and stuffs.
- Few things we had to do manually like creating domain controllers, but this was just once. Created database backup schedules to blobs.
- Helped during the workload migration to Amadeus and it was smooth. I am still supporting these environments until this August in collaboration with their Team.
- Created a Powershell Script to update SSL certificates used by HPC head node and around forty compute nodes. Our applications use these nodes for complex calculations and jobs which are involve XPRESS solver.
- I also manage our Azure AD infra which includes SSO, service principles, IAM and stuffs. Set up a sync between on-prem and Azure AD to make the identities cloud available.
- All our public DNS routes are hosted on Route 53. OTPs are sent through AWS SNS service.
- Yeah, so I understand the logic behind every cloud provider, and I help out whenever I can.

IaC

- I build images using Packer. These are mostly Windows and CentOS, but we will be moving to Ubuntu soon.
- Time to terraform (vSphere Provider, for Azure we use ARM). I am not saving the state files as of now. We are not there yet but someday.
- Ansible to configure those machines like providing access, installing SQL, Octopus agents, IIS or whatever that is needed.
- I am not a hardcore coder (oh, I wish) as of now but I can deal with Powershell, HCL, YAML and a bit of JSON. My current set up is not super immutable yet.

On-Premises

- We have four data centers, built on top of vSphere. Dell and NetApp on the backend.
- My work is mostly on the frontend because I create the environments which includes lot of Zoom calls, planning, negotiations (we want 64Gb memory, me: nope).
- I also update vCenter when required. Scheduled patching of servers using SCCM.
- Containers are running on Kube clusters which are hosted on VMs and I did a POC and deployed Rancher to manage these clusters. It’s awesome.

SYSTEMS

- Migrated all our windows servers to 2016/19 from 2012. It wasn’t in place upgrades, I re-created them and worked with DevOps to redeploy the app and then switch the DNS. Easy.
- Also, I do manage Atlassian Suite (BitBucket, JIRA, Confluence), Microsoft 365, Intune, Exchange online etc. I have worked on setting up SQL Dbs, Postgres and a little bit of Mongo.
- I did set up some highly available HaProxy load balancers with keepalived.
- NGINX as frontend proxying to IIS as the backend for some of our app servers. I am not a Linux expert (yet), but I know enough to figure out where to look.
- Have experience on setting up firewall rules on Cisco ASA devices.
- I also did set up Octopus, TeamCity, SonarQube though I am not involved with CICD as of now.
- Work with people during prod issues without breaking a sweat (being calm is my superpower). I usually go through connection strings within the code, app configs files to figure out what might be breaking. This is fun.
- Set up monitoring using Site247, PRTG for our network devices. There are alerts, threshold profiles setup to monitor all our stuffs.
- There is a logic behind everything we see, and I try to figure that out and that’s how I fix issues. Also, you need the logs.

Some thoughts:

Down the line I want to be able to automate anything that can be codified, deploy anything on any kind of infra and fix more problems. I want to learn and unlearn, build-break-fix. This is why I am looking for a change.
I am very thoughtful, flexible, open to ideas and brainstorming anytime. I have got whole lot of patience. I am just looking for a Team where we bring out the best in each other and I got nothing against the world.
P.S. I don’t have a degree as of now. It would have completed by 2020 but COVID happened, and the world changed. I just have two back logs.
